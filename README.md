# Clustering-of-MED7-Mental-model

The goal of the project was to understand how 7th-semester Medialogy students categorize and view their competencies. In order to do this, students were asked to perform a card sort on a set of skills developed at a career workshop. The card sorts were then analyzed using a Kmeans cluster analysis and visualized using R.
